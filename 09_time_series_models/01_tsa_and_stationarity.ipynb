Hence, stationarity implies that a time series does not have a trend or seasonal effects and that descriptive statistics, such as the mean or the standard deviation, when computed for different rolling windows, are constant or do not change much over time. It reverts to its mean, and the deviations have constant amplitude, while short-term movements always look the same in the statistical sense.\n",

So, in addition to the mean and variance, higher moments such as skew and kurtosis, also need to be constant, irrespective of the lag between different observations. In most applications, we limit stationarity to first and second moments so that the time series is covariance stationary with constant mean, variance, and autocorrelation. "
